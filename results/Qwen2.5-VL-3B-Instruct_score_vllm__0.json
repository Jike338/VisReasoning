        "To determine which of the given solid figures cannot be divided by a single plane into two parts that are either exactly the same or mirror images of each other, we need to analyze each figure step by step.\n\n1. **Figure A**: This figure is a simple cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner. If we draw a plane through the center of the cube, it will divide the figure into two identical parts. Therefore, Figure A can be divided into two parts that are mirror images of each other.\n\n2. **Figure B**: This figure is a cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner. If we draw a plane through the center of the cube, it will divide the figure into two identical parts. Therefore, Figure B can be divided into two parts that are mirror images of each other.\n\n3. **Figure C**: This figure is a cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner. If we draw a plane through the center of the cube, it will divide the figure into two identical parts. Therefore, Figure C can be divided into two parts that are mirror images of each other.\n\n4. **Figure D**: This figure is a cube with a smaller cube removed from one corner. If we draw a plane through the center of the cube, it will divide the figure into two identical parts. Therefore, Figure D can be divided into two parts that are mirror images of each other.\n\nSince all the figures can be divided into two parts that are mirror images of each other, the correct answer is that none of the figures cannot be divided into two parts that are either exactly the same or mirror images of each other. However, since the problem asks for the figure that cannot be divided in this way, and all figures can be divided, the answer is that there is no such figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{E}\\)."

It helps us understand the overall shape and orientation of the solid.\n\n2. **Front View**: This is a two-dimensional view that shows the shape of the solid as if viewed from the front.

The left view should show the shape of the solid as if viewed from the left.\n\nBy analyzing the given views, we can see that the left view should be similar to the front view but rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. This is because the front view shows the shape of the solid as if viewed from the front, and the left view should show the shape of the solid as if viewed from the left.\n\nTherefore, the correct left view is the one that is similar to the front view but rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nThe correct left view is option B.\n\nSo, the answer is: B"

        "To determine the shape of the solid when viewed from the front, we need to analyze the given top view and understand how the cubes are stacked in three dimensions.\n\nThe top view shows the following arrangement of cubes:\n- The top row has 2 cubes.\n- The second row from the top has 3 cubes.\n- The third row from the top has 1 cube.\n- The bottom row has 2 cubes.\n\nThis means the solid is built as follows:\n- The top row has 2 cubes, so the first two columns are filled.\n- The second row from the top has 3 cubes, so the third column is filled, and the fourth column is empty.\n- The third row from the top has 1 cube, so the fourth column is filled.\n- The bottom row has 2 cubes, so the last two columns are filled.\n\nNow, let's visualize the solid from the front:\n- The first column will have 2 cubes (from the top row).\n- The second column will have 3 cubes (from the second row from the top).\n- The third column will have 1 cube (from the third row from the top).\n- The fourth column will have 2 cubes (from the bottom row).\n\nSo, the front view will be:\n- The first column has 2 cubes.\n- The second column has 3 cubes.\n- The third column has 1 cube.\n- The fourth column has 2 cubes.\n\nThis matches the arrangement in option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."

        "To determine which of the given options can be folded into the cube-shaped paper box, we need to visualize how the unfolded net can be folded back into a cube. Let's analyze the given net step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: The net consists of 6 squares, and each square represents a face of the cube. The vertices where the edges meet will be the corners of the cube.\n\n2. **Visualize the folding process**: We need to fold the net such that the edges match up correctly to form a cube. Let's label the squares for clarity:\n   - Square 1: Top-left\n   - Square 2: Top-right\n   - Square 3: Bottom-left\n   - Square 4: Bottom-right\n   - Square 5: Front-left\n   - Square 6: Front-right\n\n3. **Determine the correct folding order**: We need to fold the net such that the edges match up correctly. Let's start by folding the top-left and top-right squares to form the top face of the cube. Then, we need to fold the bottom-left and bottom-right squares to form the bottom face of the cube. Finally, we need to fold the front-left and front-right squares to form the front face of the cube.\n\n4. **Check the options**: We need to check which of the given options matches the correct folding order. Let's assume the correct folding order is as follows:\n   - Fold the top-left and top-right squares to form the top face.\n   - Fold the bottom-left and bottom-right squares to form the bottom face.\n   - Fold the front-left and front-right squares to form the front face.\n\nBy visualizing the folding process, we can see that option D matches the correct folding order.

Let's visualize the net and try to match it to the possible folded shapes.\n\n2. **Analyze the net**: The net consists of 6 squares, and we need to determine how they will fold into a 3D shape. The key is to identify the faces that will meet at each vertex.\n\n3. **Match the net to the folded shapes**:\n   - **Option A**: This shape has a square on the bottom, a square on the left, a square on the right, and two triangles on the top. When folded, the triangles will meet the squares to form a triangular prism.\n   - **Option B**: This shape has a square on the bottom, a square on the left, a square on the right, and two triangles on the top.

        "To determine which solid can be combined with the given shapes to form the complete polyhedron, we need to analyze the structure of the polyhedron and the shapes provided.\n\nThe polyhedron is made up of 20 identical small cubes. The given shapes are:\n- Shape ①: A 3D structure with 4 cubes.\n- Shape ②: A 3D structure with 3 cubes.\n\nWe need to find a solid that, when combined with shapes ① and ②, will complete the polyhedron.\n\nLet's analyze the possible combinations:\n\n1. **Shape ① (4 cubes) + Shape ② (3 cubes) = 7 cubes.**\n   - We need 13 more cubes to complete the polyhedron (20 - 7 = 13).\n\n2. **Shape A (6 cubes) + Shape ① (4 cubes) + Shape ② (3 cubes) = 13 cubes.**\n   - This combination gives us 13 cubes, which is exactly what we need to complete the polyhedron.\n\n3. **Shape B (6 cubes) + Shape ① (4 cubes) + Shape ② (3 cubes) = 13 cubes.**\n   - This combination also gives us 13 cubes, which is exactly what we need to complete the polyhedron.\n\n4. **Shape C (5 cubes) + Shape ① (4 cubes) + Shape ② (3 cubes) = 12 cubes.**\n   - This combination gives us 12 cubes, which is not enough to complete the polyhedron (20 - 12 = 8).\n\n5. **Shape D (5 cubes) + Shape ① (4 cubes) + Shape ② (3 cubes) = 12 cubes.**\n   - This combination also gives us 12 cubes, which is not enough to complete the polyhedron (20 - 12 = 8).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only shapes that can be combined with shapes ① and ② to form the complete polyhedron are shapes A and B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nA"
