The second row continues this pattern with a three-dimensional object and a more complex two-dimensional shape.\n\nGiven this pattern, the shape that fits best in the blank should be a two-dimensional shape that is more complex than a simple line but simpler than the shapes in the second row. Option C fits this description as it is a horizontal line with three smaller horizontal lines inside it, which is more complex than a simple line but less complex than the shapes in the second row.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate option to fill in the blank is:\n\nC"

Let's consider the possible cross-sections:\n\n1. **Square (A)**: A square cross-section would require slicing the solid in a way that all four sides are equal.

The original figure is a shape that looks like a \"W\" with a horizontal line at the top.\n2.

        "To determine which of the options (A, B, C, D, E) is the original figure (on the first row) rotated clockwise by 315 degrees, we need to understand the effect of a 315-degree rotation. A 315-degree rotation is equivalent to a 45-degree clockwise rotation because 360 degrees - 45 degrees = 315 degrees.\n\nThe original figure is a globe with a stand. When we rotate it 45 degrees clockwise, the globe will be positioned such that the stand is pointing to the right and slightly downward.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- Option A: The globe is positioned with the stand pointing to the right and slightly downward, which matches the 45-degree clockwise rotation.\n- Option B: The globe is positioned with the stand pointing to the left, which does not match the 45-degree clockwise rotation.\n- Option C: The globe is positioned with the stand pointing to the right and slightly upward, which does not match the 45-degree clockwise rotation.\n- Option D: The globe is positioned with the stand pointing to the left, which does not match the 45-degree clockwise rotation.\n- Option E: The globe is positioned with the stand pointing to the right and slightly upward, which does not match the 45-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA"
