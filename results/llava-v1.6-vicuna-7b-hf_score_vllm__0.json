The pattern is such that each shape is a combination of two shapes, and each shape is a combination of two other shapes.\n\nTo complete the matrix, we need to use the pattern to create the shapes that are missing.\n\nStarting from the top left, we have a shape that is a combination of two shapes, which are a combination of two other shapes. This means that the top left shape is a combination of the top left and top right shapes.\n\nContinuing to the right, we have a shape that is a combination of two shapes, which are a combination of two other shapes. This means that the top right shape is a combination of the top left and top right shapes.\n\nMoving to the bottom left, we have a shape that is a combination of two shapes, which are a combination of two other shapes. This means that the bottom left shape is a combination of the bottom left and bottom right shapes.\n\nContinuing to the right, we have a shape that is a combination of two shapes, which are a combination of two other shapes. This means that the bottom right shape is a combination of the bottom left and bottom right shapes.\n\nNow, let's complete the matrix:\n\n- The top left shape is a combination of the top left and top right shapes.\n- The top right shape is a combination of the top left and top right shapes.\n- The bottom left shape is a combination of the bottom left and bottom right shapes.\n- The bottom right shape is a combination of the bottom left and bottom right shapes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA - B - C - D - E - F"
