The shapes transition from a circle to a triangle, then to a crescent, followed by a cube, and finally to a more complex shape.\n\nThe first four shapes seem to follow a pattern of increasing complexity and dimensionality. The last shape in the first row is a cube, which is a 3D shape. The shape that follows should also be a 3D shape that continues the complexity.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\n- Option A: A complex 3D shape.\n- Option B: A different complex 3D shape.\n- Option C: A simpler 3D shape.\n- Option D: Another complex 3D shape.\n\nGiven the trend of increasing complexity, the most appropriate option to fill in the question mark would be the one that maintains this complexity.\n\nThe answer is **D**."

The fourth shape is a more complex object with a flat top and a base.\n\nThe pattern seems to be moving from a rounded shape to a boxy shape, then to a flat circular shape, and finally to a more complex shape with a flat top.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- A: A rectangular shape with rounded edges.\n- B: A flat box with a top.\n- C: A flat rectangular shape.\n- D: A rectangular shape with a flat top and some details.\n\nThe most appropriate option that continues the pattern of complexity and flatness is option D, as it has a flat top and resembles the last shape in complexity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
