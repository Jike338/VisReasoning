To fold a piece of paper into this shape, you would need to start with a rectangular piece of paper and fold it along the lines shown in the figure. The lines indicate the folds that need to be made to transform the rectangular paper into the cube shape.\n\nLooking at the figure, we can see that the paper box has six faces, each of which is a square. To create this shape from a rectangular piece of paper, you would need to make three folds along the lines shown in the figure.\n\nThe first fold would be along the line that runs horizontally across the top of the paper box. The second fold would be along the line that runs vertically down the middle of the paper box. The third fold would be along the line that runs diagonally from one corner of the paper box to the opposite corner.\n\nAfter making these three folds, the paper would be transformed into the shape of the paper box shown in the figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA "
