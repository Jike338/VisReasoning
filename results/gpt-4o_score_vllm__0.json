        "To determine which unfolded surface is not possible, we need to consider the rule that opposite faces of the cube have the same color.\n\nIn a cube, each face has an opposite face. If opposite faces are the same color, then:\n\n- There are three pairs of opposite faces.\n- Each pair must be a different color (white, gray, black).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **A**: The arrangement shows two black squares adjacent to each other, which means they cannot be opposite faces. This is possible.\n- **B**: The arrangement shows two gray squares adjacent to each other, which means they cannot be opposite faces. This is possible.\n- **C**: The arrangement shows two black squares adjacent to each other, which means they cannot be opposite faces. This is possible.\n- **D**: The arrangement shows two gray squares adjacent to each other, which means they cannot be opposite faces. This is possible.\n\nSince all options show adjacent squares of the same color, they are all possible unfolded surfaces of the cube.\n\nTherefore, none of the options are impossible based on the given conditions. However, if we must choose one that seems less likely due to the arrangement, it would be **D**, as it has a more complex arrangement that might not easily fold into a cube with opposite faces matching.\n\nThe answer is **D**."
